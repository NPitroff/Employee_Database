## EMPLOYEE TRACKER##
This application is for the Week-12 homework to impliment "MySql" functionality through "node.js"

While there are other apps, this gives an easy user interface for any client to utilize to build a simple record
structure to not only keep track of their employees, but their roles within the company, their respective salaries, 
and the departments therin.

This is achieved through the npm "inquirer" which is used to query the client with relevant questions on how they 
would like to either update, view, or add to their database. 

Further functionality can be added to the program, including removing Employees, displaying teams lead by specific
managers, displaying total salaries for the company, and much more if desired.

Ultimately this is a framework that can be flexed to any number of applications, and that felxibility is displayed
within these files.
